# disclaimer
It's not my fault if you or your family suffer weird dreams or psychotic episodes from using this software. 

Preliminary tests show that it can be enjoyed by children aged six months and up. 

# license 
If you make money from this software I get half of it before taxes. Other than that BSD or MIT license applies, whichever is more likely to get me and my wife more free beers.
