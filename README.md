# letters
Teach yourself the letters of the swedish alphabet. 

My kid needed something better than Internet videos he finds on his own and I wanted to teach myself something about Processing/P5js.

# demo

www.internetpatrullen.se/letters

# install
Clone repo, cd into it, run 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer' or whatever, open in the browser. 

Or even better because you probably don't have python 2, try 'python -m http.server 8080'. 

Or even better still, 'php -S localhost:8080 index.html'.

# instructions
Click the upper left corner to toggle fullscreen. Click anywhere else to go to the next letter. 

# todo 
- Create toggle auto mode, with automatic and possible random progression.

- Add some sweet tunes. 

- Fix project directory structure. 

- Write convenience scripts for running it. 

- Write script for setting LAN redirect to this instead of babby's favourite sites. 

# disclaimer
It's not my fault if you or your family suffer weird dreams or psychotic episodes from using this software. 

Preliminary tests show that it can be enjoyed by children aged five months and up. 

# license 
If you make money from this software I get half of it before taxes. Other than that BSD or MIT license applies, whichever is more likely to get me and my wife more free beers.
